# Privacy Policy

*Effective date: 13/10/2018*

Thmmy No Life ("us", "we", or "our") developed the mTHMMY mobile app (the "App") as an open source application. It is provided by us at no cost and is intended for use as is.

As a user of the App, your privacy is protected and we feel a strong commitment to protect your privacy. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about the collection, use and disclosure of your data, and the choices you have associated with them.

## Data processing

To be able to offer you all functions and services of the App in the most convenient way possible and to continuously improve it, we use a number of different cloud services. This means we will transfer your data to a third party – the cloud services provider.

Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), with offices at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland and, more specifically, Firebase, a Google subsidiary with its registered office in San Francisco, CA, U.S.A., is a third party – the cloud services provider – that stores and processes your data on our behalf (the "processor", as defined in Article 4, GDPR).

### Location of processing

The majority of Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure. They could process data at any of the Google Cloud Platform locations or Google data center locations, within or outside the European Union (EU).

The Commission Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12.07.2016 allows the transfer of data from an EU controller or processor of orders to organizations in the US that have committed themselves to adhere to the framework principles of the EU-US Privacy Shield (<https://www.privacyshield.gov>), including the additional principles, by way of self-certification with the US Department of Commerce. Google is subject to these principles through self-certification with the U.S. Department of Commerce.

### General Information

* The Firebase services that we use collect and further process anonymized information, data with no personally identifiable information which can be used to trace its source so that the people whom it describes can remain anonymous. These data are not subject to the same treatment as are personal data, particularly with regards to any desire you might have for accessing it, rectifying it or erasing it (Article 11, GDPR).
* Firebase uses the Instance ID of your mobile device to identify individual installations of this mobile app. Since each Instance ID is unique to a particular application and device, they give Firebase a way to refer to specific instances of the App.
* Your IP address transmitted by the App in the context of Firebase will not be merged with other collected data.
* Legal basis for the use of Firebase is Article 6 Par. 1 S. 1 letter (a) or (f), GDPR.

The use of each Firebase service is explained below:

### Firebase Cloud Messaging

* **Purpose**: This service is essential for the funcionality of the App. It uses anonymous push notification tokens in order to determine which devices to deliver the appropriate messages to.
* **Data collected**: Instance IDs.
* **Consent**: You will be prompted to agree to the use of this service when you open the App for the first time.
* **Retention**: Firebase retains Instance IDs until we make an API call for deletion. After the call, data are removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.

### Firebase Crashlytics

* **Purpose**: This service automatically collects and delivers analyses of errors and system crashes in real time and displays them in the Firebase Console. This  helps us maintain the App and improve its stability.
* **Data collected**: Instance IDs and crash reports with information about register codes and your device, e.g. type of device and version of operating system. For more information: <https://try.crashlytics.com/security/>
* **Consent**: You will be prompted to choose if you want this service enabled when you open the App for the first time. After that, you can enable or disable it from the Settings inside the App.
* **Retention**: Crash traces and their associated identifiers are kept for 90 days.

### Google Analytics for Firebase

* **Purpose**: This service provides analytics and attribution information for statistical purposes. The precise information collected can vary by the device and environment.
* **Data collected**: Instance IDs, Android IDs, Analytics App Instance IDs and custom events created by us. For more information: <https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318039>
* **Consent**: You will be prompted to choose if you want this service enabled when you open the App for the first time. After that, you can enable or disable (and clear all collected data) from the Settings inside the App.
* **Retention**: ID-associated data are retained for 60 days. Aggregate reporting and campaign data are retained without automatic expiration.
